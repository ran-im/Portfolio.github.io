										<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
										<p>My journey into the realm of computer science has been an evolution shaped by resilience and adaptability. Initially drawn to a career in computer science, fate led me to a detour during my early academic years. Despite opting for the non-medical stream in Class 11, I discovered a challenge in chemistry that led to a pivotal decision. Acknowledging my academic strengths and weaknesses, I transitioned to commerce with mathematics midway through Class 11, ultimately completing my +2 education in this field.

											Embracing the intersection of commerce and technology, I pursued a Bachelor of Commerce (Honors) with a minor in computer science in college. The initial four semesters exposed me to a diverse range of subjects, including Python programming, Database Management System, SQL, Computer Networks, and website building tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was during this academic phase that I delved into the intriguing realms of information security and developed a foundation in analytics.
											
											In the fourth semester, a turning point emerged with the study of 'Business Research Methodologies and Analytics.' This course ignited a passion for business analytics, propelling me towards a focused career path. Eager to fortify my statistical acumen, I chose to delve into Business Statistics. Over the past few months, I have actively engaged in building projects to solidify my conceptual understanding and enhance my analytical skills. This journey reflects my commitment to continuous learning and the pursuit of a career where technology and business seamlessly converge.</p>
